# activity.gml

A basic shim/implementation of the [Discord Activities](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview) API, for GameMaker

Example code is contained within `obj_discord_sdk_example`

The source project for the SDK implementation is found in the `extensions/discord_embedded_sdk/embedded-sdk-lib` folder 

To run this example, you'll need to create a [Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications), [run the server code as well](https://github.com/Sidorakh/activity.gml-server), and [Discord's guide on setting up an application](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#run-your-application-locally).
